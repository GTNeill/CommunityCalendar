# CommunityCalendar - hardened production image (web-only, minimal CVE surface).
#
# The build stage installs the full workspace to compile the client bundle; the runtime
# stage installs ONLY packages/web production dependencies, so mobile (expo/react-native),
# desktop (electron/app-builder-bin) and build tooling (vite/esbuild/tsx/sharp/turbo/
# oxlint/drizzle-kit) never ship. See GRO-LOT-SECURITY-NOTES.md for the rationale.
